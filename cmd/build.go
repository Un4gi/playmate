-- Windows --
To build an autoplay CD for Windows, you will first need to stage
your payload in the "examples/windows" directory. At this time, only C++ 
payloads are supported. The "examples/windows" directory currently includes
two example payloads, "dwmapi-winexec.cpp" and "LaunchU3.cpp". The
"dwmapi-winexec.cpp" file will be used to create a .dll, and the
"LaunchU3.cpp" file can be used optionally as a launcher for the dll.
Note that if you change the name of you payload, you will need to 
specify the new name using the "-d" and/or "-e" flags.

The examples/windows/ directory also contains an example "autorun.inf" file
and "folder.ico" file. The "autorun.inf" contains directives for what
actions will be available upon insertion of the CD. The "folder.ico" 
file will change the appearance of the icon in the autoplay menu when 
the CD is inserted into the target computer.

-- Linux --
To build an autoplay CD for Linux, you will only need a single file
staged: the "examples/linux/autorun.sh" file. This file should contain
the commands you wish to run on the target computer upon insertion of
the CD. If you would like to deploy additional files with the "autorun.sh"
file, you will need to modify the code accordingly, as this is not supported
as an automated feature at this time.

-- Usage --
To use playmate, you will need to provide at minimum a source folder 
and a destination folder. The source folder is the location of your
payload/autorun files. The destination folder is the location where 
you wish the ISO to be stored after creation.

You can also supply various flags when building (Windows only):
-a, --arch			This specifies the architecture of the target system (x86/x64).
-d, --dll-name		This is the name of the dll to be compiled. This should match 
						the name of your staged C++ (DLL) payload.
-e, --exe-name		This is the name of the exe (launcher) to be compiled. This
						should match the name of your staged C++ launcher payload.
-f, --format		This is the payload format you would like to compile. If you
						would like to build a standalone dll, choose "dll". If
						building a dll with an exe launcher, choose "exe".
